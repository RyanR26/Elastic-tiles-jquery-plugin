This is a simple jQuery plugin which will create elastic/responsive tiles from unordered list elements. Add a new <ul> to create a new row and as many <li> items within the <ul> to create the number of tiles in the row. You can hide rows (<ul>) or individual tiles/blocks (<li>) (eg. for mobile view) with CSS and the plugin will recalculate the tile/block widths and heights to fit the full page resolution.
